This is the code of an ongoing project to create an Odoo 11 module for a veterinary clinic management.

It's based on the modeul veterinary created by Bilal that can be found in the Odoo web (https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/11.0/veterinary/).

I'm creating models for different clinical tests: blood tests, radiology, echography and citology.

I also created a calendar view for the appointments.

Next steps will be:
	- Fix the clinical test forms so appointment can be introduced with the proper filter by owner.
	
	- Add an appointment confirmation button in the form and calendar views
